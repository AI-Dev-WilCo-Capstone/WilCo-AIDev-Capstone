[130.49s -> 138.25s]  I'm dead serious. If this shit happens again, I'm fucking, for real. I'm done talking to you. I'm done talking to you.

[140.23s -> 146.70s]  This shit right here. This, this, this, this shit, all this, this petty ass dumb shit that can happen again is done.
[149.60s -> 150.48s]  Talking about what, okay?
[150.98s -> 154.52s]  This right here? What do you mean? This shit that happens every time.
[155.43s -> 156.03s]  Okay, Bradley.
[157.28s -> 161.80s]  Are you taking it serious or not? Because if you're not, then there's no point in me fucking killing another chance.
[161.80s -> 176.53s]  I'm taking it serious. I'm taking it serious. Are you there?
[176.95s -> 181.63s]  I'm here. Do you still love me?
[182.96s -> 185.62s]  Of course I still love you, Bradley. Are you crazy?
[186.20s -> 194.38s]  These first few years of fucking prison are going to be fucked up. You know what I'm saying?
[194.52s -> 197.84s]  So, I'm going to need somebody right here. You know what I'm saying?
[200.60s -> 201.22s]  I understand.
[203.05s -> 204.57s]  You can't promise me that you can do that.
[206.48s -> 210.70s]  I can try my best to be. I can try my best to be there for you, yes.
[214.17s -> 216.89s]  Fuck, fuck being here for me. You need to try to be with me.
[218.22s -> 218.62s]  Bradley?
[219.22s -> 220.76s]  Chloe, I'm serious, fool.
[221.14s -> 222.56s]  Bradley?
[223.69s -> 224.57s]  You can't do that.
[227.44s -> 232.02s]  How about we work on getting along first, and then we'll discuss that.
[232.36s -> 244.93s]  Listen, bro, if your feelings aren't from a different spot, a different part of your heart than what they have been, girl, we're not going to grow in any way.
[245.37s -> 246.43s]  There has to be understanding.
[247.45s -> 248.65s]  What are you talking about?
[248.91s -> 250.23s]  Exactly what I just said.
[250.67s -> 268.18s]  Put on two different fucking, I don't know what to fucking, I don't know what to tell you.
[268.18s -> 276.60s]  I don't know. I don't know what you mean. You don't know what to tell me why, but I do.
[277.61s -> 280.98s]  You can't, you can't try to be with me.
[283.02s -> 292.71s]  I don't know. Like I said, let's work on getting along first, and then we'll talk about this. I'll consider it. But, we have to work on getting along first.
[295.75s -> 297.69s]  You know that I've been talking to somebody?
[298.62s -> 298.96s]  Huh?
[300.12s -> 301.94s]  I said, you know that I've been talking to somebody.
[302.40s -> 309.84s]  Yeah, but he's a young ass little fucking bull, you know? Like, the kid hasn't been through shit.
[312.77s -> 313.61s]  You don't know that.
[314.01s -> 314.11s]  And neither do I.
[314.11s -> 315.75s]  What have you been through?
[316.61s -> 319.35s]  I said, you don't know that, and neither do I.
[319.75s -> 326.26s]  You're going to shoot him over me.
[329.40s -> 332.10s]  Okay, then. That's what I'm saying. So, cut that shit off.
[333.39s -> 335.47s]  That's bullshit, Bradley. Don't do that.
[335.47s -> 335.75s]  What's bullshit?
[339.80s -> 340.52s]  What's bullshit?
[345.53s -> 347.37s]  You trying to do that.
[347.81s -> 348.47s]  Trying to do what?
[348.47s -> 354.84s]  Trying to say that that's me choosing him over you, because that's bullshit.
[356.63s -> 357.95s]  Okay. Well, then choose me.
[360.22s -> 361.66s]  I'm saying stop doing that.
[362.30s -> 363.52s]  Well, I'm saying come home.
[365.00s -> 365.40s]  Bradley.
[373.20s -> 374.16s]  I'll consider it.
[374.46s -> 377.10s]  Consider it. Let's do it. Let's work on it.
[377.18s -> 379.28s]  No, I'll consider it.
[379.62s -> 387.72s]  Make you feel like I'll make you feel?
[389.58s -> 390.02s]  No.
[390.52s -> 392.94s]  See him already?
[393.44s -> 403.24s]  Where'd you see him, man?
[403.56s -> 404.81s]  What's up, God?
[404.87s -> 406.76s]  Why does it matter?
[407.22s -> 408.66s]  Where'd you see him, man? Just tell me.
[409.46s -> 410.46s]  Why does it matter?
[410.66s -> 411.56s]  Can you please just tell me?
[412.66s -> 415.28s]  We went to eat with him a few weekends ago.
[417.08s -> 417.52s]  Huh?
[419.24s -> 423.20s]  We went to eat with him a few weekends ago at Stare with you.
[424.45s -> 425.25s]  You said the kids?
[425.73s -> 429.00s]  No, we mean Caitlin and her boyfriend.
[432.67s -> 435.01s]  What's his name? Is this Peyton? Is it the same dude?
[436.19s -> 437.83s]  Fuck no, it's not Peyton.
[439.18s -> 440.34s]  What's this kid's name?
[442.54s -> 443.64s]  I'm not telling you.
[443.84s -> 444.64s]  What's his name?
[444.64s -> 447.06s]  I'm not telling you.
[447.40s -> 448.10s]  Please tell me.
[457.19s -> 458.07s]  His name's Devin.
[458.61s -> 459.29s]  Devin who?
[461.05s -> 462.33s]  Devin is his name.
[462.73s -> 463.33s]  Devin who?
[464.32s -> 466.34s]  I don't know what his last name is.
[469.29s -> 470.29s]  Why wouldn't you tell me?
[470.61s -> 476.30s]  What'd you meet him at Facebook?
[478.71s -> 479.09s]  Yeah.
[479.51s -> 489.55s]  You guys fuck already?
[490.55s -> 491.03s]  No.
[491.41s -> 493.69s]  You going to?
[496.25s -> 496.65s]  Nope.
[498.06s -> 498.90s]  You're lying to me.
[502.78s -> 503.42s]  No, I'm not.
[504.04s -> 505.60s]  You're not sexually attracted to him.
[507.13s -> 508.01s]  Of course I am.
[508.47s -> 516.87s]  You see your body and you see his and all that?
[518.50s -> 518.90s]  No.
[521.25s -> 522.41s]  Why do you feel like lying to me?
[523.71s -> 524.83s]  No, I do.
[525.55s -> 545.96s]  Are you going back in or what?
[546.40s -> 566.06s]  Don't be fucking telling me one thing and start doing fucking lying shit with me.
[567.39s -> 567.95s]  I'm not.
[573.45s -> 574.21s]  Did Ivor like him?
[576.36s -> 576.78s]  What?
[578.01s -> 578.93s]  Did Ivor like him?
[578.93s -> 581.08s]  What are you talking about?
[582.80s -> 583.86s]  He hasn't been around the days.
[584.87s -> 585.31s]  No.
[590.29s -> 593.09s]  Is Peyton just some fucking matchmaker or what?
[593.71s -> 594.07s]  No.
[595.33s -> 596.67s]  She's not a matchmaker.
[596.81s -> 597.47s]  What are you talking about?
[597.47s -> 602.31s]  Last time you were with fucking Peyton and you guys did all that shit, Caitlin was there too.
[602.59s -> 604.87s]  And with this nigga right here, Caitlin was there too.
[619.83s -> 621.63s]  That's why Caitlin just laughs at me and shit.
[621.91s -> 622.97s]  Because all the shit you said to me.
[622.97s -> 623.03s]  Nope.
[623.83s -> 625.47s]  She's not laughing at you.
[625.53s -> 626.61s]  I already told you.
[627.99s -> 630.79s]  And who gives a fuck if she was, but she's not?
[631.60s -> 632.10s]  She's what?
[632.54s -> 637.88s]  Who gives a fuck if she was, but she's not?
[638.18s -> 639.44s]  Well, I give a fuck if she was.
[639.52s -> 640.04s]  What do you mean?
[640.69s -> 642.17s]  Okay, well, she's not.
[642.31s -> 642.63s]  Bradley?
[643.17s -> 644.23s]  Stop yelling at me.
[644.23s -> 663.70s]  What the fuck is your problem?
[664.20s -> 664.52s]  A lot.
[664.60s -> 666.02s]  A lot is my fucking problem, sir.
[666.16s -> 667.06s]  A lot is my problem.
[670.19s -> 671.21s]  You gonna come home or not?
[672.92s -> 674.96s]  Bradley, I told you I'll consider it if we can start to go home.
[674.96s -> 675.96s]  Are you gonna come home or not?
[676.40s -> 677.94s]  I can't tell you yes or no.
[678.28s -> 679.24s]  Tell me yes or no.
[680.28s -> 681.74s]  I can't tell you yes or no.
[681.98s -> 683.96s]  Are you coming home or are you not coming home?
[684.40s -> 687.03s]  I'm not answering that.
[687.77s -> 688.63s]  Bro, just tell me.
[689.47s -> 690.91s]  I'm not answering that.
[691.41s -> 691.85s]  Realistically.
[693.47s -> 694.83s]  I'm not answering that, so.
[695.01s -> 695.47s]  So no.
[695.89s -> 703.92s]  No what?
[704.56s -> 705.28s]  You're not coming home.
[708.21s -> 709.66s]  Yes or no, Chloe.
[710.20s -> 711.46s]  That's all I want is yes or no.
[716.55s -> 718.91s]  I'm not taking you at a yes or no.
[719.29s -> 725.23s]  You're gonna make this shit this hard?
[725.39s -> 727.05s]  You're really gonna make me sit here and fucking wait?
[730.46s -> 732.28s]  We'll see if we can start to get along.
[733.32s -> 733.82s]  If what?
[736.58s -> 739.16s]  We will see if we can start to get along.
[739.64s -> 745.75s]  So you're gonna pursue this shit with Evan or no?
[747.94s -> 749.64s]  I'm not gonna stop talking to him.
[753.58s -> 753.90s]  Whatever.
[754.50s -> 760.87s]  You mad about it?
[763.34s -> 763.72s]  Whatever.
[764.08s -> 770.31s]  You're the best, Chloe.
[772.62s -> 786.42s]  All right,
[786.42s -> 789.34s]  so we're not even on a coach?
